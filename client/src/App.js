              <h2>Java Methods</h2>
              <p>Java is an object oriented programming language where
                  all source code must be written within a class. In these
                  classes, you will often write methods that do specific tasks.
                  Every method has a specific syntax that must be followed for
                  the program to be compiled correctly. This syntax is what will
                  tell the programmer the scope, the return type, the name,
                  and the specific parameters
                  that need to be passed into the method for it to function correctly.
